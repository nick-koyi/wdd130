        Kenya is a country located in East Africa. It is bordered by Ethiopia to
        the north, Somalia to the east, Tanzania to the south, Uganda to the
        West and South Sudan to the north west. The country is a major economic
        hub in the region with Nairobi as its capital city. My country is also
        known for its diverse wildlife, stunning landscapes and vibrant cultures
        including the Maasai tribes.
